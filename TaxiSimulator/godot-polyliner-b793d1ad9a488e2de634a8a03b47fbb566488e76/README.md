# Polyliner

Adds 3D line/ribbon mesh capabilities.<br>
Supports Godot 4.1.

# Usage

The included `LinePath3D` node uses the `Path3D` node as a source of line segments;
you can use it to easily make a smooth line.
<details>
<summary>How to make a path?</summary>
Select the `LinePath3D`, then hold Ctrl (Cmd if on a Mac) and click to create points.<br>
To add handles to a point, hold Shift and click-and-drag on a point to add curve handles to it.
</details><br>

The included `Line3D` node more or less behaves like the stock `Line2D`.<br>
Push your line points to it and a line mesh will be automatically generated.

The included `Trail3D` node forms a trail. This node will form line segments from
its previous positions. It works in global space, so it works as a child of another `Node3D`.

These nodes render lines in the same manner, and all support the same shaders.

Within `addons/godot-polyliner/shaders/` is a bunch of ready-made line shaders,
from a cylinder facsimile to a full raymarched metal chain or swirling rope,
and from a blooming light tube to a swooshing effect.

(don't forget to make your shaders unique before editing them!)
